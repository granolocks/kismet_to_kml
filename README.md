# `kismet_to_kml` gem

Install via rubygems like `gem install kismet_to_kml`.

### Usage

```
Usage: kismet_to_kml [options]
  -n, --netxml NETXML              Netxml file (required)

#### Is this needed?

There are other tools that do this including the `kismetdb_to_kml` script that
is part of
[`kismet-logtools`](https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/kismetdb/kismetdb_kml/).
That being said, I wanted to do my own thing and needed a place to put it so
here we are.
